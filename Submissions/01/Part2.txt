Part 2

I worked with nobody

First the program initializes a console object and checks to make sure
it initialized properly

Then it reads a password input with console.readPassword() again except
this time the input is being checked against the transform method with
an input of a character array.

This means that the array is a scrambled version of the password

Looking at the transform method, it makes a copy of the array, makes a second
array, and then uses ^= to shift the binary code of each of the character
entries to unscramble it.

Then it returns the unscrambled password and checks your input against it

By making a java program you can use the transform method to unscramble the
password and find that it is "battery staple"

Thus, when you type battery staple you get "Welcome back!" printed to the screen
and if you type the incorrect password, you get "Intruder detected!"
