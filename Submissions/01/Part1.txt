I worked with nobody

The program takes an input array of arguments which it does not use and error
checks to ensure that the console object properly initializes

Then it reads the password through console.readPassword which hides what
you type and checks it against the set password, "open sesame"

upon inputting the correct password it prints "Welcome back!"
upon inputting an incorrect password it prints "Intruder detected!"
